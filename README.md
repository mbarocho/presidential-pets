# Project Info
    Henhacks 2024: Best CS Educational Technology Hack
    "What is a way we can incorporate computer science into a common curriculum subject, such as math, English, or science to engage students?"

    This hack was programmed using HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and Python. It uses a Flask framework to integrate Python data with the HTML pages. JavaScript
    acts as the project's intermediary, delivering HTML inputs to our Python scripts and vice versa. Animal graphics were drawn by hand and added to the 
    project by the graphic designer.
